# Help_Lives_Healthcare_No_Show_Prediction

Using Python and Power BI, I analyzed historical healthcare appointments data to uncover patterns influencing not show of patients due to various reasons. A Decision Tree classifier was developed to predict the no show patterns, and a dynamic dashboard was built to allow users to explore appointments vacant insights. The outcome is a model that predicts patients no show reasons or patterns and a visual dashboard with interactive filters and sliders for data exploration.
